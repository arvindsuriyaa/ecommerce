## Ecommerce UI with Functionality in React.

I have created an ecommerce like UI along with required functionality to checkout out products to the payment screen. No external UI library's were used for development purposes, all the styles and layout created were done from scratch.<br/>

This project was developed by myself as part of learning experience.<br/>

Library and packages used : <br/>
1) react
2) redux
3) react-redux
4) react-table v6




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dev-dependencies in node_modules used while developing this app.<br/>
please use 'npm install', before actually starting the dev environment. 


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
